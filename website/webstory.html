<p>The movie industry, often hailed as the epitome of modern storytelling, stands as a captivating realm where creativity converges with technology, talent, and cultural expression. Spanning decades, this dynamic and ever-evolving landscape has become an integral part of global entertainment, captivating audiences and transcending borders. Beyond the enchanting narratives that unfold on the silver screen, the movie industry weaves a complex tapestry that extends its influence far beyond the confines of theaters.</p>
<p>At its core, the movie industry is a multifaceted ecosystem, comprising filmmakers, actors, writers, directors, producers, and a myriad of other creative minds, each contributing their unique talents to craft compelling stories. The collaborative nature of filmmaking fosters a delicate dance of ideas and visions, resulting in the birth of cinematic masterpieces that resonate with audiences on emotional, intellectual, and even spiritual levels. The relationships forged within the movie industry are as diverse as the stories it tells. Collaboration and synergy are at the heart of its success, with artists and technicians working in harmony to bring visions to life.</p>
<p>In this exploration of the movie industry, we will delve into the intricate relationships formed both on and off the screen, beyond traditional success metrics. From the creative collaborations that birth cinematic wonders to the societal impact that transcends the theater walls, join us on a journey through the enchanting world where imagination meets reality : the world of the movie industry.</p>

<p>In the ever-evolving realm of filmmaking, success is often attributed to the synergy between actors, scenarists, and directors. Our project seeks to unravel the intricate dynamics of this collaboration, going beyond traditional success metrics. By constructing comprehensive actor collaboration networks, we aim to explore the chemistry that arises from frequent co-starring and its impact on the success of movies. Our approach involves the creation of a web network that interconnects actors, scenarists, and directors, using the data from <strong>CMU Movie Summary Corpus</strong>.</p>

<p>If you want to reduce the number of actors in your movie, unfortunately, that depends on your scenario. You can even have one actor playing all the roles ! However, in order to ensure its success, let’s see which specific individual you should cast.</p>

<h1 id="research-questions">Research questions</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>How does the frequency of actor co-starring impact the chemistry and success of collaborative films?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>What patterns emerge when constructing and analyzing actor collaboration networks?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>To what extent does the involvement of specific individuals (actors, scenarists, directors) contribute to the overall success of a collaborative project?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>How does the collaborative network evolve over time, and are there recurring partnerships or clusters of individuals within the film industry?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>What role does genre play in shaping collaborative dynamics, and how do successful collaborations differ across genres?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Are there specific collaborative subgraphs within the network that consistently yield successful movies, and what are the characteristics of these subgraphs?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>How do factors such as creative differences, interpersonal relationships, and previous collaborative experiences impact the success of film projects within the identified networks?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Can the identified patterns and insights be applied to predict the potential success of future collaborative projects in the film industry?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>In what ways does the inclusion of scenarists and directors in the collaborative network influence the overall success of a film, and are there notable differences in the impact of each role?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>How do external factors, such as cultural trends or industry shifts, influence the dynamics of collaboration and the success of films within the identified networks?</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Addressing these research questions will likely provide a comprehensive understanding of the collaborative dynamics in the film industry and offer practical insights for future filmmaking endeavors.</p>

<p><strong>Week 1: Construct collaborative networks</strong> - Utilize the cleaned data to construct actor collaboration networks. - Establish links between actors, scenarists, and directors based on their collaborative history. - Apply network analysis techniques to identify central nodes and clusters.</p>
<p><strong>Task 1: Genre-specific subnetworks</strong> - Implement the granular approach by dividing the collaborative network into subnetworks based on movie genres. - Analyze and visualize genre-specific subnetworks. - Identify patterns and relationships within each genre.</p>
<p><strong>Task 2: Analyze collaborative subgraphs</strong> - Focus on collaborative subgraphs within each genre to determine their impact on successful movies. - Explore recurring partnerships and their influence on success. - Examine how external factors may affect specific subgraphs.</p>
<p><strong>Task 3: Prepare the datastory website</strong> - Explore the possibilities for a website using Jekyll - Prepare the layout of the website - Implement the analysis findings into the website</p>
<p><strong>Week 4 : Finalize analysis and the datastory</strong> - Synthesize findings from genre-specific analyses. - Draw conclusions and insights. - Review the prepared datastory and make changes if necessary.</p>

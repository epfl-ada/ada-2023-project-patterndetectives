In the ever-evolving realm of filmmaking, success is often attributed to the synergy between actors, scenarists, and directors. Our project seeks to unravel the intricate dynamics of this collaboration, going beyond traditional success metrics. By constructing comprehensive actor collaboration networks, we aim to explore the chemistry that arises from frequent co-starring and its impact on the success of movies. Our approach involves the creation of a web network that interconnects actors, scenarists, and directors, using the data from **CMU Movie Summary Corpus**.

## I don't like people, sorry
If you want to reduce the number of actors in your movie, unfortunately, that depends on your scenario. You can even have one actor playing all the roles ! However, in order to ensure its success, let's see which specific individual you should cast.

## Tell me Johnny, who do you see often ?
These actors practically have each other on speed dial with their frequent collaborations.

## Let's play celebrity chess !
Get ready to play a round of celebrity chess as we unravel the patterns in Hollywood's grand game of actor collaboration networks. It's not just about moves on the board; it's a strategic dance of connections, rivalries, and who's stealing the spotlight on the chessboard. Let the games begin!

In our investigation to identify the key traits of successful actor clusters, we employed a series of t-tests to assess various attributes within our dataset, including gender disparity, the frequency of film collaborations between actor pairs, and several other factors. Notably, the only attribute that yielded a statistically significant result (with a p-value below 0.05) was the age difference between pairs of actors.


The accompanying plot organizes clusters based on their average ranks, with the more successful clusters (denoted by lower average ranks) positioned on the left, and the less successful ones (indicated by higher average ranks) on the right. It is important to emphasize that a lower average rank signifies greater success. The plot reveals a discernible trend: clusters with lower ranks tend to exhibit a marginally higher age disparity, suggesting a broader age range among members of these clusters. This variation in age could be indicative of the beneficial impact of seasoned actors, who potentially contribute greater experience and knowledge to the ensemble.

### Spice it up : The return of celebrity chess with even more collaboration
Adding directors and composers do not lead to a significant change in the collaborative network. As some well known directors are also actors, they are already part of the network. For composers, they are highly tied to one or a few directors. It is expected as directors tend to keep the same composer for their movies. When clustering the nodes only on directors and composers we find that it is almost always a director that make the bridge between clusters. There a lot of 2 nodes clusters composed of one director and one composer, which agrees with what we said before.

## It's a bit more twisted than your average plot twist : internal factors

We observe that for each figure, the average movie rating for the biggest category is around 6.45.

Both the age and film count difference has high variability when the difference is big due to the small number of movies. Otherwise it averages around 6.5 pretty consistently.

Whether it is the first film for one of the actors or for both does not have a significant impact on the average rating. The difference in average rating is around 0.1 in both cases.

When looking at the number of films a pair of actors have done together, we observe a small increase in the average rating up to 5 films. After that, the average rating decreases slightly and no particular trend emerges.

Two genres have a remarkable lower average rating than the rest: Softcore Porn and Space opera with 2.4 and 2.5 respectively. On the contrary, some genres neighbour the 8.0 average rating mark: Anti-war, Culture & Society, Film Ã  clef, Tragedy and Reboot. The latter contains only three movies, thus it is less interesting. For the other, we have a least 50 movies per genre. Hence, these genres seem to be the most appreciated by the users.

# Research questions
1. **How does the frequency of actor co-starring impact the chemistry and success of collaborative films?**

2. **What patterns emerge when constructing and analyzing actor collaboration networks?**

3. **To what extent does the involvement of specific individuals (actors, scenarists, directors) contribute to the overall success of a collaborative project?**

4. **How does the collaborative network evolve over time, and are there recurring partnerships or clusters of individuals within the film industry?**

5. **What role does genre play in shaping collaborative dynamics, and how do successful collaborations differ across genres?**

6. **Are there specific collaborative subgraphs within the network that consistently yield successful movies, and what are the characteristics of these subgraphs?**

7. **How do factors such as creative differences, interpersonal relationships, and previous collaborative experiences impact the success of film projects within the identified networks?**

8. **Can the identified patterns and insights be applied to predict the potential success of future collaborative projects in the film industry?**

9. **In what ways does the inclusion of scenarists and directors in the collaborative network influence the overall success of a film, and are there notable differences in the impact of each role?**

10. **How do external factors, such as cultural trends or industry shifts, influence the dynamics of collaboration and the success of films within the identified networks?**

Addressing these research questions will likely provide a comprehensive understanding of the collaborative dynamics in the film industry and offer practical insights for future filmmaking endeavors.
